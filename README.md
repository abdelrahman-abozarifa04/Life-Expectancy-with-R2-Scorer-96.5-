## 3. üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### *Objective:*  
To uncover relationships between variables, detect anomalies, and identify key predictors for life expectancy.

### *Key Insights:*
- **Correlations:** Studying the relationship between life expectancy and predictors such as GDP, BMI, and infant mortality.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Observing distributions of variables like GDP, population, and life expectancy.
- **Missing Values:** Handling missing data effectively, using strategies such as imputation for continuous variables and modes for categorical ones.

## 4. üîß Data Processing

### *Objective:*  
To prepare the dataset for modeling by addressing missing values, converting categorical columns, and standardizing numerical features to enhance model performance.

### *Methods Used:*
- **Handling Missing Values:**  
  - *Imputation*: Missing data imputed using mean for continuous variables (e.g., GDP, BMI) and mode for categorical variables (e.g., "Status").
  
- **Categorical Feature Handling:**  
  - *One-Hot Encoding*: 'Status' (Developed/Developing) converted to binary columns using one-hot encoding to make the dataset compatible with ML algorithms.
  
- **Normalization:**  
  - *Standardization*: Features like GDP and BMI were standardized via z-score normalization, ensuring all variables are on similar scales for better model performance.
